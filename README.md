# Practical Deep Learning

This repo contains my exploration across a few important concepts in Deep Learning. 
From Convolutional Neural Networks to Language Modeling, I have documented my journey with 
Deep Learning and Neural Networks here.

## makemore

Makemore is a Neural Network model that takes in a list of names as an input and produces similar and unique names as an output. We utilize a few different methods to create this model. 

Methods:
- Bigram modeling
- MLP
- More coming soon!

Serves as a foundational stepping stone to fully comprehend how Neural Networks work and different ways they can be utilized for the same project!

Inspired by the great Andrej Karpathy

## micrograd

Micrograd is a fundamental way of understanding how neural networks work by building a model completely from scratch. It gives fantastic insight into the calculus behind backprogation and how a network is trained and tweaked. 

Mainly used as an example I can show to fellow students in Computer Science/ Robotics Club on how Neural Networks function!

Also inspired by Andrej Karpathy. (I'm a big fan)

## coursework

From pytorch basics all the way up to building a smaller version of Alex Net, I used Convolutional Neural Networks to produce an image classifier.
